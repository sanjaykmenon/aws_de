This course provides an overview on using various AWS services for data engineering. The course is divided into 6 weeks, each covering a different aspect of data engineering on AWS. Each weeks consists of series of content, labs and homework questions. The course is designed to be completed in 6 weeks, with 8-10 hours of effort per week.

The following prequisites are required to complete the course:

 - An AWS account
 - Basic knowledge of Python
 - Basic knowledge of SQL
 - Terraform basics

I've created this course as I've enjoyed the [Datatalks.Club Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main) but did not find one that focused primarily on AWS services.

The student will be using the NYC Taxi Trip dataset for the labs and homework questions. The dataset can be downloaded from the link for the DataTalksClub zoomcamp itself or from the link below:
